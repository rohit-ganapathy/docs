Blocked Numbers helps you shut the noise out with a single click. Your team's time is too valuable to waste on spam, telemarketing pitches, or disruptive callers. The Blocked Numbers feature protects your agents by preventing unwanted numbers from reaching them. Once added to the blocked list, these contacts are immediately stopped from calling into your practice!

## Use Cases

1. **Prevent Spam and Telemarketing Disruptions** - Block persistent spam, robocalls, or telemarketers from reaching your team and interrupting operations.

2. **Avoid Internal Distraction from Job Seekers** - Prevent repeated calls from individuals seeking employment from reaching business lines.

3. **Protect Staff from Harassment or Abusive Callers** - Block contacts reported by staff for inappropriate or threatening behavior.

4. **Filter Low-Intent Leads** - Block numbers from contacts who repeatedly call but show no genuine intent (e.g., prank callers or information collectors).

5. **Manage High-Volume Campaign Overflow** - Temporarily block overflow numbers or misrouted traffic from ad campaigns gone viral or wrongly targeted.

## Tips

- **Log a Clear Reason**: Always select a blocking reason and add a note (even if optional). It helps future admins understand the context.
- **Review Periodically**: Audit the blocked list monthly or quarterly to ensure no useful contacts were blocked mistakenly or need to be reinstated.
- **Use Specific Rather Than Broad Numbers**: Avoid blocking prefixes or partial numbers unless there's a strong pattern—focus on exact problem numbers.
- **Empower Agents to Report**: Let agents suggest numbers for blocking, which admins can review and act on.

## Benefits

- **Reduces Agent Distraction** - Ensures staff are focused on legitimate inquiries, not nuisance calls.
- **Improves Productivity** - Fewer interruptions from irrelevant or inappropriate calls.
- **Enhances Call Quality Analytics** - Keeps call reports clean by excluding spam and irrelevant traffic.
- **Better Call Queue Management** - Keeps high-value lines free for patients and leads who matter.

## Best Practices

- **Document Reasons with Notes** - If a contact is blocked due to harassment or behavior, note it clearly. If it's a marketing caller, include company details if known.
- **Sync with CRM or Practice Rules** - If your practice has a CRM or complaint logging process, make sure blocked numbers are reflected across systems (if applicable).
- **Train Staff to Recognize Red Flags** - Create internal guidelines on when to escalate numbers for blocking (e.g., repeat spam, fraud, abuse).
- **Monitor Patterns Before Blocking** - For edge cases (e.g., silent calls, hang-ups), monitor for repeated patterns before blocking permanently.
